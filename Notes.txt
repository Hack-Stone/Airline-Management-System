Flight Class:

Flight class contains the basic information about a flight like flightNumber, source, destination, totalSeats, and availableSeats.
Methods like getFlightInfo(), bookSeat(), and cancelBooking() are used to get flight details, book a seat, and cancel a booking.
AirlineReservationSystemGUI Class:

This class is responsible for creating the GUI and handling user interactions.
GUI Components:
JTextArea for displaying flight details and user bookings.
JButton for performing actions (view flights, book, cancel, exit).
JScrollPane to allow scrolling for larger areas of text.
JPanel for organizing components in the layout.
Methods:
displayAvailableFlights(): Displays available flights and their seat statuses.
bookFlight(): Prompts the user to enter a flight number and tries to book a seat.
cancelBooking(): Prompts the user to enter a flight number and cancels a booking.
viewMyBookings(): Displays the user's current bookings (for simplicity, this is done by showing flights that have been booked).
Event Handling:

actionPerformed(): Handles the button clicks and triggers corresponding actions such as viewing flights, booking, canceling, and exiting.
Sample Output (GUI):
Flight Details Section: A JTextArea displaying available flight details.
Buttons: Options to view flights, book a flight, cancel a booking, or exit the program.
Bookings Section: Shows booked flights if any.
How it Works:
View Flights: Displays available flights with seat details.
Book a Flight: Takes flight number input and books a seat if available.
Cancel a Booking: Takes flight number input and cancels the booking, freeing up a seat.
Exit: Exits the application.
Enhancements:
You can further enhance the system by adding user authentication (for keeping track of users), integrating a database for persistent storage, and improving the UI layout for a better user experience.
